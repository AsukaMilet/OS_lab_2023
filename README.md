The repository contains labs related to the operating systems course I took in 2023.

Two main experiments are included
1. Simulation of process scheduling experiments with FIFO(First In First Out), SJF(Shortest Job First), RR(Round-Robin) and MLFQ(Multi-level Feedback Queue) policies.
2. Page replacement strategy for virtual memory, including FIFO, original LRU and LRU-K.
